# lellow
An app to find all things Yellow

First need to run the node JS server generated from Swagger

./nodejs/npm install
./nodejs/node .

Or if you prefer run the node JS server modified from Swagger to use Express
./express/npm install
./express/node .

Then run the app to read the data source and put up a list of "Lellow" things to map out.
